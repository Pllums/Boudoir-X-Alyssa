							“I can’t say enough great things about Alyssa and the gorgeous
							work that she does! Anyone that has ever taken boudoir photos has
							probably had the same nerves and insecurities as I had walking
							into Alyssa’s studio. But those nerves quickly disappeared as she
							and Jasmine (the incredibly talented makeup artist) got to work on
							hair and makeup. Once the shoot started, I was so wrapped up in
							Alyssa’s vision for each look/pose that I didn’t have a chance to
							feel self conscience. She was wonderful about showing me the shots
							after she took them which gave me so much more confidence. In
							addition to Alyssa’s in- studio talent, her turn around time on
							editing proofs was outstanding! I was picking photos for my book
							36 hours after I left her studio. I would recommend Alyssa 1000
							times over!” <br />

							“I don't even know where to start. Alyssa is amazing. Being
							photographed isn't my favorite thing, and when you're being
							photographed in next to nothing, it's pretty intimidating. Alyssa
							made it anything but intimidating, she made it empowering. Not
							once did I feel uncomfortable, inadequate, or embarrassed during
							my shoot, and that is so important when doing something so
							vulnerable. She was so good about explaining and demonstrating
							each pose, which really helped me feel confident. I got my photo
							proofs back the same day, so fast I was shocked! And the photos
							were AMAZING! I was (am still am) in disbelief that the person in
							the photos is me! I had the photos I selected printed in a book to
							give as a gift to my husband. Alyssa did a great job arranging the
							photos, it turned out so good! I had kind of did this shoot as a
							bucket list thing for myself and thought it would be a
							one-and-done scenario, but I can for-see myself doing another
							shoot with Alyssa again someday because it was such a positive
							experience!” <br />

							was so fun, kind, and encouraging that I felt comfortable in no
