			<p class="cont3_p">
				I am your new hype woman, nice to meet you. I'm a boudoir photographer
				<br />
				located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I have quickly found that boudoir is
				<br />
				my calling. Right away I saw the empowerment and confidence it brought
				<br />
				the women I was working with. I started to appreciate that all bodies<br />
				are different and still just as beautiful. My entire life I have<br />
				struggled with body image and comparison to others, never finding what
				I<br />
				had to be good enough. Boudoir has given me a whole new view on that.<br />
				Helping others feel beautiful enough, young enough, confident enough
				and<br />
				perfectly acceptable exactly where they are TODAY pushes me to take
				that<br />
				same advice. Every woman I have worked with has chosen boudoir for<br />
				different reasons. Whether it be for their partner, celebrating a
				mile<br />
				stone, or helping them find their confidence. What ever the reason
				may<br />
				be I have seen a tremendous impact on how they view themselves, and I<br />
				can't wait to help YOU. I look forward to working with you. If you
				have<br />
				any questions feel free to ask away over on my contact page. xoxo<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
